- concurrent session is browser

Okta supports concurrent sessions, which means a user can be signed into multiple applications at the same time. 
When a user authenticates with Okta, a session is established. This session is independent of any individual application. As long as the session is valid, the user can access any application that they have permissions for without needing to re-authenticate. However, itâ€™s important to note that while Okta handles the authentication, the management of these sessions (such as session timeouts or restrictions on concurrent sessions) is typically handled at the application level. Therefore, the ability to have concurrent sessions would depend on the specific settings and capabilities of the applications being used.
